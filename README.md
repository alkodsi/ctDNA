# ctDNA
Pipelines for analyzing ctDNA targeted sequencing data

This has all the experimental and intermediate pipeline and other scripts.

The two main pipelines you need to look at are:
- ctDNAlign.scala - Alignment pipeline
- newMutect2_2.scala - Joint Variant calling
- mutectDoubleCallingAll.scala - Joint variant calling for only FFPE and baseline
